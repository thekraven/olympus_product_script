We are currently working on extract_files.sh

this particular file pulls the files and libs necessary to compile from the phone.

the best method is to dd a system image and add in the files to the extrac_files.sh

to create a system.img 

dd if=/dev/block/mmcblk0p12 of=/sdcard/imgs/system.img

good luck!
